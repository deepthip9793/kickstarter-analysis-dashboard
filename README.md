Insights of data set:
•            In this visualisation try to find a relation between the success/failure of a project to the goal amount the projects have.
•            We find the total number of projects successful and failed in each category of Projects and compare it with the median Goal and Pledged amount for that category.
•            The success of a project depends on multiple factors - the Goal amount of the project, project category, the title of the project or even the time at which the project was posted.
•            We try to analyse if the hour of day at which the project was launched has any effect on the success.
•            For this hour has been extracted from from the launch date. For each hour, the graph displays the total number of failed and successful projects.
•            In this analysis, we observe the trend in the success rate of projects over the years.
•            We also try to find the relationship of the success rate with the number of backers that invest in the projects.
